# Haptic Navigation Shoes for the Visually Impaired

This is my mini project for helping blind people walk safely using sensors and vibration motors inside shoes.

## 👟 What It Does

- Detects obstacles (ultrasonic)
- Detects pits and stairs (LiDAR + MPU6050)
- Detects water (water level sensor)
- Detects fast-moving objects (radar)
- Alerts user with vibration and buzzer
- Emergency SMS/call using GSM

## ⚙️ Components Used

- Arduino Nano / Uno
- Ultrasonic sensor
- LiDAR sensor
- MPU6050
- Radar sensor
- Vibration motors
- Buzzer
- SIM900A GSM module
- Water level sensor
- Piezoelectric plates (for charging)

## 📢 Alerts

Each sensor gives vibration in different patterns. Buzzer helps in emergencies. Push button sends SMS using GSM.

## 💡 Future Plans

- Add GPS tracking
- Add mobile app
- Solar power option
